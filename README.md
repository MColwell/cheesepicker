# cheesepicker
A program to help you pick a cheese.
Currently incomplete. If you actually want to pick a cheese, you should go with aged Gouda, Emmentaler, or Cantal for a hard cheese; just get Brie for a soft cheese, it's a classic because it's so good. If you don't want a cows-milk cheese, get Manchego.
